      <div class="me">
        <p> Hello! Welcome to my page.</p>
        <p> My name is Sara Lys, I’m 21 years old. I was born in Madrid, Spain.</p>
        <p> Currently I’m an exchange student at the University of Miami, Florida.</p>
        <p>I have made this page to share a little bit about me and who I am,
         as well as showing you some pictures from my latest travels.</p>
         <p>Since I was a kid because of my parents work I had the opportunity
         to tag along in their travels.</p>
         <p>Since then I’ve developed a love for photography and try to immortalize
         every place that I go to with my phone.</p>
         <p>I hope you guys enjoy my page and if you need to contact me go for it!</p>
         <p>Lots of love,</p>
         <p>Sara Lys</p>
